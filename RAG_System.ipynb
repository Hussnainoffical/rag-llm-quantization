        "### Key Features Implemented:\n",
        "- **Model**: `unsloth/Qwen2.5-3B-bnb-4bit` – pre-quantized with Unsloth's optimized 4-bit (NF4) format\n",
        "- **Dynamic Quantization**: Unsloth selectively keeps higher precision for critical parameters (e.g., attention weights, outliers) while compressing others to 4 bits → better accuracy + lower VRAM than standard bitsandbytes 4-bit\n",
        "- **Domain-specific documents**: Custom text files on Python, Machine Learning, and RAG\n",
        "- **Chunking**: 200-word chunks with 50-word overlap for better context retention\n",
        "- **Embedding**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer\n",
        "- **Vector Store**: FAISS (FlatL2 for exact search on small corpus)\n",
        "- **Retrieval**: Top-k similar chunks fetched and injected into prompt\n",
        "- **Generation**: Grounded responses using the quantized LLM\n",
        "- **Memory Optimization**: Designed to run efficiently on free Colab T4 GPU (~6-7GB VRAM peak)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Unsloth Dynamic 4-bit?**\n",
        "Standard 4-bit quantization (bitsandbytes) compresses all weights uniformly → can hurt accuracy.\n",
        "Unsloth uses **dynamic scaling**: detects outlier weights and keeps them in higher precision → near FP16 accuracy with 4-bit memory footprint.\n",
        "Result: A 3B model runs in ~5GB VRAM instead of 12+GB."
